In user space, I created myList.c including all the functions. Before implementing send and recv, I was able to add nodes and messages. After send and recv are implemented, I started getting segmentation faults and was not able to find out the cause. 

In kernel space, created kernel_myList.c. I could not my insert function because it kept saying incompatile points while they were working in userspace. Access permission and mutex locks are added to all functions in kernel.

test file for userspace c file is the main function.

test file for kernel_myList.c is test.c
